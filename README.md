# CloudShop CLI Application

A command-line marketplace application that allows users to buy and sell items.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Building

Run the build script to set up the environment:
```sh
./build.sh
```
The script will:
- Check for Python 3.6 or higher
- Create a virtual environment (`venv/`) if it does not exist
- Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Remove the existing `cloudshop.db` database file (if present)
- Ensure `cloudshop.py` and `run.sh` are executable

---

### üê≥ Build and Run with Docker

You can also use Docker to build and run this project, without manually running `build.sh`.

**Build the image:**
```sh
docker build -t cloudshop .
```

**Run the container:**
```sh
docker run -it cloudshop
```

**Run commands from a file:**
```sh
docker run -i cloudshop < commands.txt
```

**Mount a host folder to the container (e.g., to persist the database):**
```sh
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app cloudshop
```

---

## Running

Before running, ensure the virtual environment has been set up by executing `build.sh`. Then, start the application using:
```sh
./run.sh
```
This will:
- Verify that the virtual environment (`venv/`) exists
- Activate the virtual environment
- Run `cloudshop.py`
- Deactivate the virtual environment upon exit

You can also process commands from a file:
```sh
cat commands.txt | ./run.sh
```
or use:
```sh
./run.sh < commands.txt | tee output.log
```
to write the STDIN to a file.

## Commands

The application supports the following commands:

| Command | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `REGISTER` | Create a new user account | `REGISTER <username>` |
| `CREATE_LISTING` | Create a new item listing | `CREATE_LISTING <username> <title> <description> <price> <category>` |
| `DELETE_LISTING` | Remove an existing listing | `DELETE_LISTING <username> <listing_id>` |
| `GET_LISTING` | View details of a specific listing. Username is taken just for authentication. | `GET_LISTING <username> <listing_id>` |
| `GET_CATEGORY` | View all listings in a category. Username is taken just for authentication. | `GET_CATEGORY <username> <category>` |
| `GET_TOP_CATEGORY` | Show the category with most listings. Username is taken just for authentication. | `GET_TOP_CATEGORY <username>` |

## Database

The application uses SQLite for data storage. The database file is created in the current directory as `cloudshop.db` and is reset each time `build.sh` is run.
